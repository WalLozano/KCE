            All outdoor events in the city of Kansas City that require multiple permits requiring the coordination of a number of city departments, including alcohol, food, dancing, music, street or sidewalk closures, fire permits, police security planning, and EMS needs, will be required to fill out an Outdoor Event Application.
            <br>
            <br>
            All applications will be reviewed and status updates will be visible on your My Events page. Submission of an application does not guarantee event approval; final approval will not be issued until all approvals have been granted and all applicable requisites have been met.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some small events will not need to use this application, including block parties, film productions, and small park events without road closures. Please contact Evenergy with questions.

    <div class="panel">
        <p class="bottom_space">
            NEW! To get a Catering Permit or Non-Profit Special Events Permit from Regulated Industries, you no longer need to submit (upload) your other event related city permits with your application to Regulated Industries to get your state approval letter!! You still need to upload your catering contract, detailed event layout, letter of approval for the sale of alcohol from the property owner, and proof of your non-profit tax exemption status (for non-profit events) – so please carefully review the requirements. And you will need to allow additional processing time for the State of Missouri Permits, which you need to submit the Regulated Industries before your final KCMO alcohol permit is issued.
