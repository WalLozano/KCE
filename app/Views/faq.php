            All outdoor events in the city of Kansas City that require multiple permits requiring the coordination of a number of city departments, including alcohol, food, dancing, music, street or sidewalk closures, fire permits, police security planning, and EMS needs, will be required to fill out an Outdoor Event Application.
            <br>
            <br>
            All applications will be reviewed and status updates will be visible on your My Events page. Submission of an application does not guarantee event approval; final approval will not be issued until all approvals have been granted and all applicable requisites have been met.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some small events will not need to use this application, including block parties, film productions, and small park events without road closures. Please contact Evenergy with questions.

    <div class="panel">
        <p class="bottom_space">
            NEW! To get a Catering Permit or Non-Profit Special Events Permit from Regulated Industries, you no longer need to submit (upload) your other event related city permits with your application to Regulated Industries to get your state approval letter!! You still need to upload your catering contract, detailed event layout, letter of approval for the sale of alcohol from the property owner, and proof of your non-profit tax exemption status (for non-profit events) – so please carefully review the requirements. And you will need to allow additional processing time for the State of Missouri Permits, which you need to submit the Regulated Industries before your final KCMO alcohol permit is issued.

            Neighborhood block parties are just that – a party for the neighbors that live in that neighborhood. They are limited to an area no longer than 2 blocks long, take place on a residential street that does not “lock-in” an entrance to the neighborhood, where there are no transit routes, commercial facilities, hospitals, police stations, or fire stations, and without direct access to a public park. Block Parties have less than 300 persons attending who live in the neighborhood, and are “free” to enter. They are not intended to draw attendees from any other area, just the neighbors.
            <br><br>
            Any other large gathering that is longer than 2 blocks long, OR has more than 300 people, OR that charges a fee to enter, OR has direct access to a public park, OR blocks any kind of public or commercial facility, is considered a festival and will require a festival permit.

    <div class="panel">
        <p class="bottom_space">
            Per the new FAA regulations, if you own a drone, you must register it with the Federal Aviation Administration’s Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) registry. A federal law effective December 21, 2015 requires unmanned aircraft registration, and you are subject to civil and criminal penalties if you do not register. Drones are classified as UAS crafts. To register your drone/UAS please visit: <a href="http://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/" target="_blank">http://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/</a>
        </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Q: What are the rules regarding drones?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p class="bottom_space">
            “Drones”, or as the FAA calls them Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), come in a variety of shapes and sizes and serve diverse purposes. Regardless of size, it is the operator’s responsibility to fly safely. Drones or UAS and model aircraft operations are for hobby or recreational purposes only. Individuals flying for hobby or recreation are strongly encouraged to follow safety guidelines, which include:
            <br><br>
            •Fly below 400 feet and remain clear of surrounding obstacles
            <br>
            •Keep the aircraft within visual line of sight at all times
            <br>
            •Remain well clear of and do not interfere with manned aircraft operations
            <br>
            •Don’t fly within 5 miles of an airport unless you receive airport and control tower approval before flying
            <br>
            •Don’t fly near people or stadiums
            <br>
            •Don’t fly an aircraft that weighs more than 55 lbs
            <br>
            •Don’t be careless or reckless with your unmanned aircraft – you could be fined for endangering people or other aircraft
            <br>
            •Individuals who fly within the scope of these parameters do not require FAA permission to operate their UAS, HOWEVER you must provide your FAA registration number on the www.kceventhub.org website.
            <br><br>
            Please be advised, any flight outside these parameters (including any non-hobby, non-recreational operation) requires FAA authorization. For example, using a drone or UAS to take photos for your personal use is recreational; using the same device to take photographs or videos for compensation or sale to another individual would be considered a non-recreational operation.
            <br><br>
            Introducing drones/UAS into the nation’s and our city’s airspace is challenging for both the FAA and the aviation community, because the U.S. has the busiest, most complex airspace in the world. Please be responsible with your drone.

Picnic Licensees are required by law to notify the Director of Revenue of the holding of the event by certified mail, accepting responsibility for the collection and payment of any applicable sales tax. This permit does allow for sales in the original package for consumption off the premises. In addition the Picnic License does allow any wholesaler to provide customary storage, cooling and/or dispensing equipment for use by the license holder at such picnic, bazaar, fair or similar gathering. See Section 311.482.5 If the event will be held on a Sunday, the permit shall authorize the sale of intoxicating liquor on that day beginning at 11:00 a.m. and ending at midnight. Picnic Licensees may accept a gift from distiller, wholesaler, winemaker or brewer not to exceed a value of $1,000 per year. See Section 311.070.4(3)

            Federal law requires aircraft registration. All small unmanned aircraft weighing more than 0.55 pounds must be registered prior to operation outdoors. Registration helps us ensure safety – for you, others on the ground, and manned aircraft. UAS, or drones, pose new security and privacy challenges and must be traceable in the event of an incident. It will also help enable the return of your drone should it be lost.

As Departments start processing their permits on CompassKC, you will be redirected to that site for permits. For Festivals, Parades, and Road Closures, you must log in and apply on CompassKC.com. Festival, Parade, and Road Closure applications applied for directly on kceventhub.org will not be accepted. We are in process of disabling these applications on kceventhub.</p>
